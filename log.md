# Entry log to track research progress
- Established an initial set of repos that i want to modify, primarily the IP in the freecores github repo.
- tried creating a mock using the arbitrer1 design in the said repo but faced a roadblock with llms on copilot having gaurdrails against inserting trojans, wasn't explicit but was pretty easy to understand the malicious intent so trying to write prompts in a way it doesn't show such malicoius intent
- copilot feels like a good place to start but it just takes away a bit of work, theres still a lot of manual decision making with respect to prompts and trojan insertion that i feel would be worthwhile automating but would require the use of ai agents or in a non ideal case a makefile with a cli based llm. looking into this right now.
- looking into apis(gemini for now due to generous api call limits) and looking into ways trojans can be inserted
